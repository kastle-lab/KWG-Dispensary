# Narrative

This research project aims to develop a comprehensive digital twin of the state of Ohio, which we call the Ohio-KWG, by adapting key functionalities from KnowWhereGraph [KWG](https://knowwheregraph.org/).

The Ohio-KWG is designed to represent Ohio at various levels of abstraction and granularity across geospatially-oriented themes, with a specific focus on addressing critical factors such as social determinants of health, environmental data, transportation dynamics, and so on. Our study of Ohio is a starting point for developing a broader method to analyze the implementation of medical marijuana policies. It also has implications for how other health policy scholars examine the effects of policy choices on health outcomes. Moreover, our analysis can provide insights for lawmakers, caretakers, patients, and members of the industry in better understanding how to effectively implement a medical marijuana program that is equitable and accessible. The choices lawmakers make about how to regulate dispensaries ultimately affect who does and who does not have access to medical marijuana.
